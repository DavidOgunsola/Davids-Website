     <h1 style="colour:black;">Personal Information</h1>
        <p style="color:black;">My name is David Ogunsola, I am 19 years old coming from a Nigerian background, however I was born in Australia. I am studying my first year of IT and from my voice you may be able to tell that I’ve lived in North America. When I was seven my family and I packed our bags from Australia and moved to a little town called Windsor in Ontario Canada.</p>
        <h2 style="colour:black;">Interest In It</h2>
          <p style="color:black;">My interest in IT became relevant in my life because it is something I feel you really have to work towards and it is a career that keeps you busy. From my personal endeavours I tend to have vast amount of free time that goes wasted playing video games or watching endless amount of YouTube or streams. My interest in the IT world began after my first year of University where I did a Business Administration degree. During this time it felt like I was coasting through and not giving my all because it was mainly an auditory learning style, whereas with IT I feel like there is more to actually do and I adore the action of testing my abilities due to the impact of competitive video games.

I decided to choose RMIT due to it variety. At my previous University (ACU) did not offer an IT course. RMIT was the best option due to a multitude of reasons. RMIT is a place where I feel welcomed and secure due to its diversity and the amount of people I already know. This makes it easier to enjoy myself on campus.

During my studies of this 3 year Bachelor course I expect to be able to gain the vital IT skills. With these skills I hopefully will obtain I would like to use these to ensure I can secure a safe and profitable job. With this course I would want to ensure I gain the skills of programming, HTML, CSS and much more. These will used to increase and better my profile.</p>

  <p style="color:black;"> From these results I can conclude that I am more of a hands-on person who like to have my voice heard. While at the same time I do like to keep to myself when I can. I believe that these traits make me a great team member. My willingness to express my ideas out is crucial in a team sense.

When forming a group, I feel like I need to work with people who are willing to listen to different opinions and take different approaches to obtaining our goal.</p>
    <h5 style="colour:black;">Project Idea</h5>
        <p style="color:black;">In this IT project there will be the construction of a mobile app that will enhance users for efficient and safe trading and selling of goods. This project is an app where people can connect with each other through their mobile devices and organise a meet up at one of the business set location to purchase a sell goods. This app is created to ensure people can purchase and sell goods safely without fear of scammers.</p>
           <p style="color:black;">The main reason for the creation of this app is to ensure safety among all people who are looking to sell and buy goods. This is due to the rising crime related to selling of goods on other competitive markets. For example, stated by Maxwell in 2022 “Since the beginning of the global pandemic there have been 13 murders,” in relation to consumers purchasing good through Facebook market place. This app will ensure that situations like these never occur. This will be ensured by the amount of security precautions that will be put in place to keep the community safe.</p>
             <p style="color:black;">Within this app, there will be a multitude of steps that will be taken into account in order for an individual to use our services. To ultimately perfect this app, first people will need to sign-up through the app and provide relevant detail for authentication and safety purposes. This includes providing relevant ID, verification and personalization.</p>
               <p style="color:black;">This will have a long structure, however it will be positive as it will ensure safety for all individuals. First, when a person creates an account they will provide their relevant information and be verified to being using this service. Once, this is done and the person is verified they will receive an identification card that they will use whenever they buy or sell a product using our service. To continue with the process, a seller will list a product onto the app and those who are interested or looking for this product will make enquiries and through text the two parties will hopefully come to a conclusion with a set price. When this price is agreed all is left is to set a time and place at one of our set locations to make the exchange. For protection of the individuals an administrator will always be present at the time of exchange to ensure everything operates correctly.</p>
                 <p style="color:black;">In terms of payment, buyers can use cash, checks, mobile payments, electronic bank transfers or even trades. However, this will be up to what the seller prefers. All the important information can be found on the seller profile page where you can see their preferences.Customers will also be able to gain points which translate to money that can be used on our app. This can be gained by having good reviews from seller or buyers. This is done to help motivate people to refrain from being rude or trying to scam other consumers.</p>
                   <p style="color:black;">In order to create this app a multitude of factors must be taken into account. This includes software, hardware and any other necessary equipment. When creating this a software must be chosen that can be applicable on different platforms, such as Windows, Mac, Android and Linux. To create this application HTML5 will be the main software that is used. HTML5 is the recent version of the HTML language, and is a significant departure from past markup techniques. The goal of the major improvements to the language was to standardise the various new ways that developers were using it. As well as to promote a common set of web development best practices. (Wood 2020)</p>
                     <p style="color:black;">If this application is done correctly the benefits of its purpose will be very beneficial. The oriinal problem si people were hesitant to use external selling cites because they were unsure of the security and safety. With this app it promotes safety among all sellers and will increase the amount of sellers and buyers which will ultimately increase the trust within the community.</p>
